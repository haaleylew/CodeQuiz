# CodeQuiz
In my code quiz app I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I emphasized on using Javascript to provide quiz questions and user selects an answer, If correct this then generates a score and renders on the final page of results. At the end of the quiz you are presented with the scores page where you can enter intitails and save your results and compare how you did against your peers.

    When the app is deployed you are shown the start button.

    Then you click the start the timer starts at 75 seconds (each questions allows 15 seconds to answer)

    When you answer the question correctly

    Then 1 point is added to your score

    When you answer the question Incorrectly

    Then 10 seconds to deducted from your time

    When the quiz is over you are shown the results page
    
    Then you can enter your initials and save your score

For future devolopment I would like to add color to the questions to turn red if answered incorrect and green if correct. As well as add more questions.
